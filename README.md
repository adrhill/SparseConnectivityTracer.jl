Fast Jacobian and Hessian sparsity detection via operator-overloading.

> [!WARNING]
> This package is in early development. Expect frequent breaking changes and refer to the stable documentation.

## Installation 
To install this package, open the Julia REPL and run 

```julia-repl
julia> ]add SparseConnectivityTracer
```

## Examples
### Jacobian

For functions `y = f(x)` and `f!(y, x)`, the sparsity pattern of the Jacobian of $f$ can be obtained
by computing a single forward-pass through `f`:

```julia-repl
julia> using SparseConnectivityTracer

julia> x = rand(3);

julia> f(x) = [x[1]^2, 2 * x[1] * x[2]^2, sin(x[3])];

julia> jacobian_pattern(f, x)
3×3 SparseArrays.SparseMatrixCSC{Bool, Int64} with 4 stored entries:
 1  ⋅  ⋅
 1  1  ⋅
 ⋅  ⋅  1
```

As a larger example, let's compute the sparsity pattern from a convolutional layer from [Flux.jl](https://github.com/FluxML/Flux.jl):

```julia-repl
julia> using SparseConnectivityTracer, Flux

julia> x = rand(28, 28, 3, 1);

julia> layer = Conv((3, 3), 3 => 2);

julia> jacobian_pattern(layer, x)
1352×2352 SparseArrays.SparseMatrixCSC{Bool, Int64} with 36504 stored entries:

```

The type of index set `S` that is internally used to keep track of connectivity can be specified via `jacobian_pattern(f, x, S)`, defaulting to `BitSet`. 
For high-dimensional functions, `Set{Int64}` can be more efficient .

### Hessian

For scalar functions `y = f(x)`, the sparsity pattern of the Hessian of $f$ can be obtained
by computing a single forward-pass through `f`:

```julia-repl
julia> x = rand(5);

julia> f(x) = x[1] + x[2]*x[3] + 1/x[4] + 1*x[5];

julia> hessian_pattern(f, x)
5×5 SparseArrays.SparseMatrixCSC{Bool, Int64} with 3 stored entries:
 ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅
 ⋅  ⋅  1  ⋅  ⋅
 ⋅  1  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅
 ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  1  ⋅
 ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅

julia> g(x) = f(x) + x[2]^x[5];

julia> hessian_pattern(g, x)
5×5 SparseArrays.SparseMatrixCSC{Bool, Int64} with 7 stored entries:
 ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅
 ⋅  1  1  ⋅  1
 ⋅  1  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅
 ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  1  ⋅
 ⋅  1  ⋅  ⋅  1
```

For more detailled examples, take a look at the [documentation](https://adrianhill.de/SparseConnectivityTracer.jl/dev).

### Global function tracing

The functions `jacobian_pattern`, `hessian_pattern` and `connectivity_pattern` return conservative sparsity patterns over the entire input domain of `x`. 
They are not compatible with functions that require information about the primal values of a computation (e.g. `iszero`, `>`, `==`).

To compute a less conservative sparsity pattern at an input point `x`, use `local_jacobian_pattern`, `local_hessian_pattern` and `local_connectivity_pattern` instead.
Note that these patterns depend on the input `x`:

```julia-repl
julia> f(x) = ifelse(x[2] < x[3], x[1] ^ x[2], x[3] * x[4]);

julia> local_hessian_pattern(f, [1 2 3 4])
4×4 SparseArrays.SparseMatrixCSC{Bool, Int64} with 4 stored entries:
 1  1  ⋅  ⋅
 1  1  ⋅  ⋅
 ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅
 ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅

julia> local_hessian_pattern(f, [1 3 2 4])
4×4 SparseArrays.SparseMatrixCSC{Bool, Int64} with 2 stored entries:
 ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅
 ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅
 ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  1
 ⋅  ⋅  1  ⋅
```
