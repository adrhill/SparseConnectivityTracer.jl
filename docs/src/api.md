## Internals
SparseConnectivityTracer works by pushing `Number` types called tracers through generic functions.
Currently, three tracer types are provided:

```@docs
SparseConnectivityTracer.ConnectivityTracer
SparseConnectivityTracer.GlobalGradientTracer
SparseConnectivityTracer.GlobalHessianTracer
```

We also define alternative pseudo-set types that can deliver faster `union`:

```@docs
SparseConnectivityTracer.DuplicateVector
SparseConnectivityTracer.RecursiveSet
SparseConnectivityTracer.SortedVector
```
